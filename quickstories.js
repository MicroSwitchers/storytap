Let's go out!\"\nMaya pulls on her snow pants with mom's help - pull, pull, pull.\nShe pushes her feet into her warm boots all by herself - stomp, stomp.\nMom pulls a soft hat over Maya's ears and Maya zips up her puffy coat.\n\"Mitts on!\" says Maya, wiggling her fingers inside her mitts.\nMom opens the door and whoosh - cold wind blows in!\nMaya steps outside and crunch, crunch, crunch go her boots.\nShe bends down and scoops up some cold white snow.\n\"It feels cold!\" Maya laughs.\nShe throws the snow high in the air and it drifts down all around her.\nLater, Maya's cheeks are pink and her nose is cold as they return inside to get warm."

The water is just like a mirror!\"\nLittle Giraffe looked again. She stuck out her tongue — and so did the water giraffe!\nShe giggled and giggled.\n\"I like her,\" said Little Giraffe. \"She's silly — just like me!\"\nAfter a big drink, she trotted home, happy to know that her reflection would be there again the next day."

When she was awake there was always so much to do. But when she was tired and back in her bed, her red teddy bear was always there to say goodnight, as she falls asleep."

        "text": "Leo found his box of instruments on the shelf where he put it away yesterday. He reached in to find his drum. Boom, boom, boom! He hit it with his hands and it made a big sound that he could feel in his tummy. Then he picked up his shaker and shook it fast—rattle, rattle, rattle! Dad clapped and said \"More, more!\" so Leo grabbed his xylophone and tapped it with the stick—ding, ding, ding! Each part made a different sound. He had so much fun playing them all together, making happy music fill the room. When he was all done, he put them back in the box on the shelf, where he would find them the next day."
