Let's go out!\"\nMaya pulls on her snow pants with mom's help - pull, pull, pull.\nShe pushes her feet into her warm boots all by herself - stomp, stomp.\nMom pulls a soft hat over Maya's ears and Maya zips up her puffy coat.\n\"Mitts on!\" says Maya, wiggling her fingers inside her mitts.\nMom opens the door and whoosh - cold wind blows in!\nMaya steps outside and crunch, crunch, crunch go her boots.\nShe bends down and scoops up some cold white snow.\n\"It feels cold!\" Maya laughs.\nShe throws the snow high in the air and it drifts down all around her.\nLater, Maya's cheeks are pink and her nose is cold as they return inside to get warm."
